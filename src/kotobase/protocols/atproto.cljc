(ns kotobase.protocols.atproto
  "atproto.kotobase.net — AT-Protocol XRPC projection of kotobase
  tenant records (ADR-2607171700, KRP §3.2 Record / §5).

  SCOPE GUARD: this is the DATA-plane record API over kotobase tenant
  graphs — it is NOT a social PDS and does not touch the aozora.app
  consolidation (ADR-2607062200). No app.bsky.*, no firehose, no
  handle resolution here.

  Mapping:
    (did, collection nsid) → host collection [:kotobase.at/records did nsid]
    rkey                   → doc key
    record                 → doc value (JSON-decoded, string keys)
    blobs                  → shared block space (kotobase.protocols.blocks)

  Implemented XRPC subset (v0.1):
    GET  /xrpc/com.atproto.repo.getRecord?repo&collection&rkey
    GET  /xrpc/com.atproto.repo.listRecords?repo&collection
    POST /xrpc/com.atproto.repo.putRecord     {repo collection rkey record}
    POST /xrpc/com.atproto.repo.deleteRecord  {repo collection rkey}
    GET  /xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getBlob?did&cid

  Authentication (CACAO) is the deploy shell's job, same as the
  kotobase.net Worker (kotobase-client mints, the edge verifies)."
