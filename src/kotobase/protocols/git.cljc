  "git.kotobase.net — git dumb-HTTP READ surface over kotobase
  (ADR-2607171700).

  DIRECTION GUARD: ADR-2607072300 (actor public data) stands — a git
  journal in the actor's own repo stays the primary source and
  kotobase a derived index. This namespace is the other, non-competing
  concern: kotobase acting as an object/ref STORE that can serve git's
  dumb HTTP protocol for repos whose objects were pushed into it (via
  the library fns below, gated upstream by kotoba-rad signing —
  identity/authorization only, per ADR-2607072200).

  Mapping:
    refs    → IStore collection [:kotobase.git/refs <repo>]   refname → sha
    objects → IStore collection [:kotobase.git/objects <repo>] sha → bytes
    HEAD    → refs doc under key \"HEAD\", value \"ref: refs/heads/<b>\"

  Dumb-HTTP endpoints (read-only; git clients can fetch over this):
    GET /{org}/{repo}/info/refs               \"<sha>\\t<refname>\\n\" lines
    GET /{org}/{repo}/HEAD                    symref line
    GET /{org}/{repo}/objects/{2-hex}/{38-hex} loose object bytes

  v0.1 stores loose-object bytes as opaque strings supplied by the
  writer and does NOT verify sha1(bytes) == key; verification and the
  smart protocol (upload-pack) are declared follow-ups in the ADR."
