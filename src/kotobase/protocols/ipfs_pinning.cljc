  "IPFS Pinning Service API (https://ipfs.github.io/pinning-services-api-spec/)
  projected onto the shared block space `kotobase.protocols.blocks` already
  reads/writes (ADR-2607172210 — this extension stays inside
  kotobase-protocols rather than becoming a 4th IPFS-adjacent repo, since it
  is pure incremental extension of the exact same block space that
  `kotobase.protocols.ipfs`, `kotoba-lang/ipfs`, and `gftdcojp/net-kotobase-ipfs`
  already share; see the Rejected section of that ADR).

  This is the WRITE-SIDE companion to `kotobase.protocols.ipfs`'s read-only
  gateway, not a relaxation of it: `ipfs.cljc`'s docstring says the HTTP
  surface is 'READ-ONLY by design' and that writes 'go through the library
  fn `blocks/put-block!` inside an authenticated deploy shell' — a pinning
  request IS exactly that authenticated-deploy-shell write path, made real
  over HTTP. It lives in its own namespace/handler (and, per router.cljc, its
  own subdomain) rather than adding write methods to `ipfs.cljc` itself, so
  '`GET`/`HEAD` on the ipfs surface is always side-effect-free' stays
  mechanically true.

  HONESTY NOTE — v0.1 has no pinning daemon: the real Pinning Service API
  spec models a pin request as async work that transitions
  queued → pinning → pinned/failed while a remote node fetches+pins the CID
  from the given `origins`. This library has no background worker and no
  peer connectivity, and does not act on `origins` at all — they are
  accepted and stored for request/response shape compatibility only, never
  dialed. So a request here is decided **synchronously at POST time** and
  can only ever land in one of two terminal statuses:
    - the CID's block is already present locally (`blocks/get-block`) →
      `\"pinned\"`
    - the CID's block is NOT present → `\"failed\"`, with a human-readable
      `info.reason`. We deliberately do NOT return `\"queued\"` for the
      missing-block case: queueing would imply a pipeline that will
      eventually complete, and none exists. A real async daemon (fetch CID
      from `origins`, flip status queued→pinning→pinned/failed in the
      background) is the obvious extension seam if one is ever built.

  Mapping:
    request id  → `hash/fingerprint` over `cid + \"|\" + now + \"|\" + seq`,
                  where `seq` is a monotonic counter obtained by
                  `-append`-ing a throwaway event to the
                  `:kotobase.protocols.ipfs-pinning/id-seq` stream (IStore
                  stamps every appended event with a monotonic `:seq` — this
                  reuses that instead of keeping local mutable state, so the
                  library stays pure over the injected store). Guarantees a
                  fresh id even for two pin requests of the same cid at the
                  same `now`.
    pin request → IStore doc `[:kotobase.protocols/pins requestid]`
                  `{:pin/cid :pin/name :pin/status :pin/created :pin/origins}`.
    DELETE      → tombstones the pin **request** doc only (nil value, same
                  convention `s3.cljc` object DELETE uses) — the underlying
                  block is untouched. Multiple pin requests may reference the
                  same block, exactly like `blocks.cljc`'s own
                  content-addressed dedup: pins and blocks are different
                  lifecycles.

  Implemented subset (v0.1):
    POST   /pins               create a pin request — body {cid, name?, origins?}
    GET    /pins/{requestid}   fetch one pin request's status
    GET    /pins               list pin requests — `cid=`/`status=` filters
    DELETE /pins/{requestid}   remove a pin request (not the block)

  Deliberately out of scope v0.1 (documented here, not silently dropped):
  `name=`/`before=`/`after=`/`limit=`/`meta=` list filters, `POST
  /pins/{requestid}` (\"replace\"), `delegates`, per-pin `meta`, and any real
  peering/fetch against `origins`. Authentication (the Pinning API spec's
  bearer token) is the deploy shell's job, same split every other surface in
  this repo uses (CACAO verification lives at the edge, not in the engine)."
