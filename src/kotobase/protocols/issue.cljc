(ns kotobase.protocols.issue
  "issues.kotobase.net (v0.1 prototype) — a GitHub Issues/PR-shaped
  activity surface over kotobase, so a repo's day-to-day work (bug
  reports, feature proposals, code review, merge decisions) can be
  driven from this stack instead of github.com.

  This is the HTTP-API gap the `kotoba-issue` library was designed to
  fill but never got wired to a network surface for (see
  `90-docs/adr/2607061600-kotoba-issue-ledger-shared-libs.edn` in the
  com-junkawasaki/root superproject — its cloud-itonami `/effects` API
  phase was explicitly descoped as too risky to ship untested; this
  namespace is the same vocabulary, built test-first, as a fresh v0.1).
  It does not depend on `kotoba-issue` itself (that library isn't
  cljs-portable-verified here yet) — it's a self-contained
  reimplementation of the same issue → proposal(=PR) → review → merge →
  audit vocabulary, over the same `kotobase.store/IStore` seam every
  other surface in this repo uses.

  WIRE FORMAT IS EDN, NOT JSON. Every other surface here (s3/atproto/
  git/pinning) speaks JSON because an external spec forces it
  (AT-Proto XRPC, the Pinning Service API). This surface has no such
  constraint — it is internal-only, Clojure-shaped data (`:issue/*`
  keys) all the way down to the IStore docs, so the wire format stays
  EDN rather than round-tripping through a JSON string-key convention.
  `pr-str`/`clojure.edn/read-string` (already the convention this
  workspace's other JSONL-adjacent code uses for embedded blobs, e.g.
  `local-manimani`'s `manimani.issue-store`) — no separate codec
  namespace needed the way `kotobase.protocols.json` exists for XRPC.
  Request/response bodies are `pr-str`'d maps with keyword keys;
  content-type is `application/edn`.

  Mapping (one doc per entity, IStore doc space):
    issue     → [:kotobase.issue/issues repo] id → {:issue/id :issue/title
                :issue/body :issue/status \"open\"|\"closed\" :issue/author
                :issue/created}
    proposal  → [:kotobase.issue/proposals repo] id → {:proposal/id
                :proposal/issue-id :proposal/rationale :proposal/risk
                :proposal/status \"open\"|\"merged\"|\"rejected\"
                :proposal/author :proposal/created}
    review    → [:kotobase.issue/reviews repo] id → {:review/id
                :review/proposal-id :review/verdict
                \"approve\"|\"reject\"|\"request-changes\" :review/comment
                :review/reviewer :review/created}
  IDs come from `-append`-ing a throwaway event to a per-repo
  `[:kotobase.issue/id-seq repo]` stream and reading back its stamped
  `:seq` — the same monotonic-counter-via-IStore trick
  `kotobase.protocols.ipfs-pinning` already uses, so this stays a pure
  function of the injected store (no local mutable counter state).

  Endpoints (repo = first 2 path segments, org/repo):
    POST /{org}/{repo}/issues                    create — body {:title :body? :author?}
    GET  /{org}/{repo}/issues                     list (status= filter)
    GET  /{org}/{repo}/issues/{id}                one issue + its proposal ids
    POST /{org}/{repo}/issues/{id}/proposals      propose — body {:rationale :risk? :author?}
    GET  /{org}/{repo}/proposals/{id}             one proposal + its reviews
    POST /{org}/{repo}/proposals/{id}/reviews      review — body {:verdict :comment? :reviewer?}
    POST /{org}/{repo}/proposals/{id}/merge        merge — requires >=1 approve review

  v0.1 HONESTY NOTE — deliberately out of scope (documented, not
  silently dropped): no risk-tiered auto-merge (every merge needs an
  explicit approve review, cf. kotoba-issue's read-only-auto-merge
  tiers), no delegate/signer-quorum authorization (that's nekko's job,
  not wired here — see the superproject investigation this ADR-less
  prototype came out of), no issue↔proposal auto-close, no pagination.
  Write auth is the deploy shell's job same as every other surface in
  this repo (CACAO/Bearer/SigV4 — see kotobase-protocols-worker's
  README, `Auth` section)."
