  "Host-based dispatch for the kotobase protocol surfaces
  (ADR-2607171700, ADR-2607172210):

    s3.<apex>       → kotobase.protocols.s3
    ipfs.<apex>     → kotobase.protocols.ipfs
    atproto.<apex>  → kotobase.protocols.atproto
    git.<apex>      → kotobase.protocols.git
    pinning.<apex>  → kotobase.protocols.ipfs-pinning
    issues.<apex>   → kotobase.protocols.issue

  plus a single-origin fallback for deploys that only own one
  hostname: /ipfs/*, /xrpc/* and /pins/* dispatch by their
  protocol-inherent prefixes (/pins is the exact path shape the
  ipfs.github.io pinning-services-api-spec itself uses, so it doubles
  as both the single-origin mount and the spec-native path — no
  stripping needed), /s3/*, /git/* and /issues/* by stripped mount
  prefixes.

  ROUTING NOTE — why `pinning` gets its own subdomain instead of
  reusing `ipfs`: kotobase.protocols.ipfs documents its HTTP surface as
  READ-ONLY BY DESIGN (blast-radius principle, ADR-2607072000) — GET on
  ipfs.<apex> is meant to always be side-effect-free. The Pinning
  Service API is a write surface (POST/DELETE /pins) that happens to
  share the same underlying block space; mounting it under the `ipfs`
  subdomain would blur that read-only invariant at the *routing* layer
  even though the handler code stays separate. A distinct `pinning`
  subdomain keeps 'ipfs.<apex> is always safe to GET' mechanically true,
  mirrors how real pinning services are actually deployed (a separate
  host/API from the gateway, e.g. Pinata's api.pinata.cloud/psa vs. a
  plain IPFS gateway), and gives a deploy shell one clean place to gate
  write-capable auth (the Pinning API's bearer token) without
  special-casing paths under a nominally read-only host.

  The apex defaults to \"kotobase.net\" but is injectable — the same
  router serves a self-hosted mesh peer on any domain. This module
  plans routes; actually answering on *.kotobase.net DNS requires the
  deploy-shell ADR + credentials described in ADR-2607171700
  (:not-decided), and ipfs.kotobase.net stays owned by
  gftdcojp/net-kotobase-ipfs (ADR-2607072000)."
