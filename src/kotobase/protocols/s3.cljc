(ns kotobase.protocols.s3
  "s3.kotobase.net — an S3-compatible object surface projected onto the
  kotobase IStore document space (ADR-2607171700, KRP §3.4 Location).

  Mapping:
    bucket        → IStore collection [:kotobase.s3/objects <bucket>]
    object key    → doc key (may contain '/')
    object value  → {:bytes :content-type :etag :last-modified}
    every write   → audit event on :kotobase.protocols/audit

  Implemented subset (v0.1):
    PUT    /{bucket}/{key}          store object
    GET    /{bucket}/{key}          fetch object
    HEAD   /{bucket}/{key}          metadata only
    DELETE /{bucket}/{key}          delete (idempotent 204)
    GET    /{bucket}?list-type=2    ListObjectsV2 (Key/ETag/Size, prefix=)

  Deliberately out of scope here: SigV4 authentication (the deploy
  shell owns auth, exactly as CACAO verification lives in the
  kotobase.net Worker, not in the engine), multipart upload,
  versioning. ETags are kotobase.protocols.hash fingerprints — a
  checksum, NOT a CID (KRP §3.3)."

  "Byte length of an object, whichever era its record is from.

  An object value used to be REQUIRED to carry its body inline as
  `:bytes`. A deploy shell may now keep the bytes on a block plane and
  store `{:cid … :size …}` here instead — which is what
  s3.kotobase.net does, because bodies do not belong on the datom
  plane (superproject ADR-2608039970) and because the inline path was
  binary-unsafe.

  `:size` is therefore preferred and `(count (:bytes o))` is the
  fallback, never the other way round: for a record without inline
  bytes the fallback yields 0, and a listing that reports every object
  as empty is wrong in the one way nobody notices — it parses, it
  validates, and every size is a lie."
